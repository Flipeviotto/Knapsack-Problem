# Unbounded Knapsack Problem
 <p>This is my solutions for the unbounded knapsack problem.</p>
 <p>The **BB.c** is a solution using only Branch and Bound.</p>
 <p>The **BBRD.c** is a solution using Branch and Bound and Dominace Relation.</p>
 <p>The **gerador.c** will beget size and priority of the objects.</p>
 <p>The objects are kept in *elementos.txt*.</p>
 <p>The programs will return the runtime and the sum of the priority best solution.</p>
