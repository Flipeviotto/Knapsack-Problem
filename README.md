# Unbounded Knapsack Problem
 <p>This is my solutions for the unbounded knapsack problem.</p>
 <p>The <b>BB.c</b> is a solution using only Branch and Bound.</p>
 <p>The <b>BBRD.c</b> is a solution using Branch and Bound and Dominace Relation.</p>
 <p>The <b>gerador.c</b> will beget size and priority of the objects.</p>
 <p>The objects are kept in <b>elementos.txt</b>.</p>
 <p>The programs will return the runtime and the sum of the priority best solution.</p>
