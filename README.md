# Unbounded Knapsack Problem
 
  <p><i>Peço que quem se basear em meus códigos me coloque como co-autor.</i><p>
  
 <p>This is my solutions for the unbounded knapsack problem.</p>
 <p>The <b>gerador.c</b> will beget size and priority of the objects.</p>
 <p>The objects are kept in <b>elementos.txt</b>.</p>
 <p>The <b>BB.c</b> is a solution using only Branch and Bound.</p>
 <p>The <b>BBRD.c</b> is a solution using Branch and Bound and Dominace Relation.</p>
 <p>The <b>MOPT.c</b> and the first and the second codes, will use the priority/size as reference for put it in the knapsack.</p>

 <p>The <b>MOT.c</b> will use size of the object as reference for put that in the knapsack.</p>
 <p>The <b>MOP.c</b> will use priority of the object as reference for put that in the knapsack.</p>
 <p>The programs will return the runtime and the sum of the priority best solution.</p>
