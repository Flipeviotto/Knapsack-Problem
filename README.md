# Unbounded Knapsack Problem
 
  <p><i>Peço que quem se basear em meus códigos me coloque como coautor.</i><p>
  
 <p>Those are my solutions for the unbounded knapsack problem.</p>
 <p>The <b>gerador.c</b> will beget size and priority of the objects.</p>
 <p>The objects are kept in <b>elementos.txt</b>.</p>
 <p>The <b>BB.c</b> is a solution using only Branch and Bound.</p>
 <p>The <b>BBRD.c</b> is a solution using Branch and Bound and Dominace Relation.</p>
 <p>The <b>MOPT.c</b> and the first and the second codes are using the priority/size as reference for put the objects in the knapsack.</p>

 <p>The <b>MOT.c</b> will use size of the object as reference for put the objects in the knapsack.</p>
 <p>The <b>MOP.c</b> will use priority of the object as reference for put the objects in the knapsack.</p>
 <p>The programs will return the runtime and the sum of the priority best solution. The runtime is stored in text files and that is used by Calculador.c to calculate the average time.</p>
